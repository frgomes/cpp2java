cpp2java parses a XML file produced by Doxygen (which should contain
documentation obtained from C++ sources) and 'tries' to produce Java
skeleton classes.

The translation is far from perfect.
Anyway, it makes life easier when C++ sources are 'well behaved'.
Templates, in particular, are known to break the translation.
